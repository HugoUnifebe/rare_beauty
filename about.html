            <p>Rare Beauty is breaking down unrealistic standards of perfection.</p>
            <p>This is makeup made to feel good in, without hiding what makes you unique—because Rare Beauty is not
                about being someone else, but being who you are.</p>

            <h1>A Note From Our Founder</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I think Rare Beauty can be more than a beauty brand—it can make an impact. I want us all to stop
                comparing ourselves to each other and just start embracing our own uniqueness.</p>

        <div>
            <p>We are on a mission to help everyone celebrate their individuality by redefining what beautiful means. We
                want to promote self-acceptance and give people the tools they need to feel less alone in the world.</p>
            <p>Our vision is to create a safe, welcoming space in beauty—and beyond—that supports mental well-being
                across age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, cultural background, physical or mental ability,
                and perspective.</p>
            <p>We believe in the beauty of imperfections.
                <br>
                We nurture a caring, respectful community.
                <br>
                We create meaningful connections and relationships.
                <br>
                We champion authenticity and positivity.
                <br>
                We lead with transparency to build trust.
                <br>
                We believe there is power in being vulnerable.
